# Toolformer Enhanced: Master's Project Repository


THIS IS A WIP. NOT MEANT FOR PUBLIC USEAGE YET.

## Introduction

Welcome to the repository of my master's project, an enhanced version of the Toolformer research. This project builds upon the innovative concepts introduced in the original Toolformer paper, aiming to extend its capabilities and applications. Due to the unavailability of the official repository, this project is developed based on the `toolformer-luci` repo by Lucidrain, with significant improvements and custom enhancements.

## Features

- **Enhanced Model Architecture:** Incorporates modifications to the original Toolformer model, introducing efficiency and accuracy improvements.
- **Extended Database:** A comprehensive and meticulously developed database that surpasses the original in terms of depth and breadth.
- **Custom Tool Integration:** Integration of new tools and services that were not covered in the original Toolformer, providing a more versatile experience.
- **Improved Usability:** Enhanced user interface and documentation, making it easier for researchers and developers to utilize the project.
